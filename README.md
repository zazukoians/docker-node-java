# Node with Java 11 JRE Docker Image

This image is built on the latest `node:14-buster` image and installs Java 11 JRE (OpenJDK) as well.

It simply adds Java 11 JRE. There is no override of any commands, everything should behave like the original `node` image.

If you have any problems with this image please report issues on Github. Pull requests & suggestions are also welcome.

We use the image for some pipelines where we need both Node and Java to do stuff.

### Use the pre built image

The pre built image can be downloaded using Docker.

    docker pull zazukoians/node-java


### Build the Docker image by yourself

You can also adjust and build the image according to your needs. Just clone the repository and then execute the build command.

    docker build -t zazukoians/node-java .
